# Raw Kubernetes Events Receiver

Receiver for ingesting Kubernetes Events in their raw format, exactly as the Kubernetes
API returns them.

Supported pipeline types: logs

> :construction: This receiver is in **ALPHA**. Configuration fields, behaviour and log data model are subject to change.

## Configuration

The following settings are optional:

- `namespaces` (default value is `[]`): Namespaces to collect events from. Empty array means all namespaces and is the
  default.
- `max_event_age` (default value is `1m`): Maximum age of collected events relative to receiver start time. The default
  setting of 1 minute means that we're going to collect events up to 1 minute backwards in time.
- `auth_type` (default value is `serviceAccount`): Authentication type for the Kubernetes client. Valid values are:
  `serviceAccount`, `kubeConfig`, `tls` and `none`.
- `consume_retry_delay` (default value is `500ms`): The retry delay for recoverable errors from the rest of the pipeline.
  Don't change this or the related setting below unless you know what you're doing.
- `consume_max_retries` (default value is `10`): The maximum number of retries for recoverable errors from the rest of
  the pipeline.

```yaml
receivers:
  raw_k8s_events:
    auth_type: serviceAccount
    namespaces: []
    max_event_age: 1m
    consume_max_retries: 10
    consume_retry_delay: 500ms
```

The full list of settings exposed for this receiver are documented in
[config.go](./config.go).
